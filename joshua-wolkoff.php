	<h2 class="topic">Introduction</h2>

	<p>I am a senior majoring in computer science and philosophy. Ever since my sophomore year when I took Philosophy of Mind (I highly recommend this class) I have been extremely interested in consciousness and concepts like free will and determinism. I pursued this idea more in computer science classes like Artificial Intelligence and Machines and Consciousness. I have taken many other computer science classes throughout the last three years including: 170 (obviously), 172, 173, 214, 252 and 278.</p>

	<h2 class="topic">Background</h2>

	<p>What are some tidbits of information about you, Josh, you might ask. Well for one I fenced competitively for over 9 years in both national and international tournaments. When I came to college though I hung up my epee but whenever I’m home for long enough I like to dust it off just for fun. I am also the president of the Undergraduate Philosophy Council (you should check it out on Fridays at 2:15pm in Lattimore 501) which I think is one of the most relaxed clubs on camps because all we do is just meet once a week to eat snacks and talk about cool philosophical topics. My final tidbit is that I have an on campus job as a building manager for the Spurrier/Genesee buildings so if you ever see me sitting at the desk in either of those buildings say hi (or don’t… either way its fine).</p>

	<h2 class="topic">Work</h2>

	<p>I have had a wide range of jobs since high school, where I was a cashier at Whole Foods. In college I worked at the campus Starbucks for a year (the only perk was that you got to take home the leftover pastries every night but otherwise the job gets a rating of “needs improvement”). The summer of my sophomore year I worked as a software engineering intern at The MITRE Corporation creating a web application as part of a small agile team. This most recent summer I was a Civic Digital Fellow with Coding it Forward and worked in the General Services Administration creating reproducible cloud infrastructure in Amazon Web Services with technologies like Terraform, and Ansible. My sophomore year I was an RA in Southside. While I liked being an RA, I hated Southside because it was created by the devil to steal undergraduate student’s happiness.</p>

	<h2 class="topic">Interests</h2>

	<p>A big interest of mine is travel. I first caught the travel bug the summer after my freshman year when I travelled throughout Israel, Palestine, Vietnam and Thailand for two and a half months. Because it was so amazing, I took the fall of my junior year off (pro tip- you only need seven semesters to graduate from UofR so if you want to do something cool for a semester do it and save on tuition at the same time) to travel alone throughout Georgia (the country, not the state), Nepal, and India for almost five months. Throughout these trips I was able to trek to Everest Base Camp, meet the Dalai Lama, motorbike throughout Vietnamese rice fields, learn about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict first hand, and get lost more times than I can count. TLDR: if you get the chance to travel you should definitely take it.</p>
