	<h2 class="topic">Introduction</h2>

	<p>As a fifth-year student at the University of Rochester, I am double majoring in Business Finance and Art History, with a minor in Computer Science. Due to computer science and codingâ€™s popularity and its extensive use in all kinds of fields and the business world, I have decided to re-classify from Class of 2019 to Class of 2020 in order to complete this challenging but extremely useful minor and coding abilities. Until now, I have acquired coding experience including Python, R Studio, HTML, CSS and little knowledge of JavaScript Plugins and I am thrilled to learn more from both my professors and classmates.</p>

	<h2 class="topic">Background</h2>

	<p>My hometown is in Shanghai, China, but I have moved to San Francisco Bay Area since when I was thirteen years old. I studied at a Christian school in which I skipped my eighth grade and started from high school immediately. During my fantastic four years in high school, I have demonstrated strong interest in visual designs and various categories of art including calligraphy, painting, photography, and etc. With further curiosity, I have begun learning the technological instruments and software, particularly Adobe Photoshop and Blender.</p>

	<h2 class="topic">Work</h2>

	<p>While spending my summer break back in Shanghai in the past few years, I have had three internships in which two internships were at consulting companies and the other one was at an asset management company. Through the extensive training and the intensive work environment in consulting company, I have become proficient in data analysis through the use of coding and technical tools, reporting current market benchmarks and trends, and constructing interactive and animated electronic reports for customer use according to their desired criteria. Additionally, during the investment banking internship, I performed due diligence, prepared valuation analysis and client presentations. I have participated in an acquisition deal and an Initial Public Offering in which the transaction values over thirty million dollars.</p>

	<h2 class="topic">Interests</h2>

	<p>Outside of school works and internships, I spend my free time with my hobbies and moreover exploring my possibilities in different kinds of areas, including sports and music. I am particularly interested in playing tennis, swimming, skiing, and golf. During other times, I have dedicated my energy to philanthropy and charity activities in which I consider them significant and memorable. For six years, I have gone to Seattle annually and served as a volunteer to plan and hold fundraisers in order to help with the education of vision-impaired children; and the program has helped over fifty students to progress from elementary school through college.</p>
