			<p>My love for numbers and making a change in the world has resulted in me taking an interest in Business, Computer Science & Robotics. During my Junior year, I went to study abroad in Shanghai, China which was a life changing experience. Aside from the great food that I enjoyed, I got a chance to put my python programming skills into practice. I worked with a startup called, MIRO AI - a sports AI company. They focused on image processing of athletes in marathons. It is through this experience I got a chance to learn more about Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence & the power of Big Data. From then on, my life has never been the same again. I am always looking for opportunities to enhance my knowledge and skills in the Data & the Technology sector. The language I am getting fluent at: python, statistics, machine learning and databases. My hope is that I can work work with numerous companies who have access to large data so that I can do what I do best ~ organize it, analyze it & interpret it to derive the best value.</p>

			<p>As a fifth-year student at the University of Rochester, I am double majoring in Business Finance and Art History, with a minor in Computer Science. Due to computer science and codingâ€™s popularity and its extensive use in all kinds of fields and the business world, I have decided to re-classify from Class of 2019 to Class of 2020 in order to complete this challenging but extremely useful minor and coding abilities. Until now, I have acquired coding experience including Python, R Studio, HTML, CSS and little knowledge of JavaScript Plugins and I am thrilled to learn more from both my professors and classmates.</p>

			<p>I am a senior majoring in computer science and philosophy. Ever since my sophomore year when I took Philosophy of Mind (I highly recommend this class) I have been extremely interested in consciousness and concepts like free will and determinism. I pursued this idea more in computer science classes like Artificial Intelligence and Machines and Consciousness. I have taken many other computer science classes throughout the last three years including: 170 (obviously), 172, 173, 214, 252 and 278.</p>
