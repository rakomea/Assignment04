This page gives some brief insight into the lives of three University of Rochester students, two of whom are majoring in Computer Science, and one who is pursuing it as a minor. 

# Ontology
- Each student has a name
- Each student is studying computer science
- Each student has an introduction

## Taxonomy
- Student name
- Relationship to computer science (major/minor)
- Introduction

### Choreography
The order of the students is determined by the alphabetical order of their first (or last!) names.

# CSS Architecture 
For the design of this website I chose to do a Z-pattern layout for the homepage and an F-layout for the student pages. The Z layout worked best for the homepage because it had a low amount of conent, whereas the F layout was useful for reading the larger amount of content within the student page. I used repeated color with alternating grey and white boxes as a way of creating contrast between each of the sections to improve readability, and to distinguish between the students with a Computer Science major and minor.
