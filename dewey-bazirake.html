	<h2 class="topic">Introduction</h2>

	<p>I am an international student from Uganda, East Africa currently studying in the United States. My belief in education to make a positive change has always been a driving factor in my academics, work and travel. My hope is that to learn the necessary skills in computer science, finance and management to lead organizations and companies that will make a fundamental change in our world. We are becoming a more interconnected world thanks to technology, common language and easier transportation mechanisms. This gives me optimism as we can always work holistically as humans to advance in technology, protect our environment for future generations and lead a new era of sustainable prosperity. For more details into my background, technical skills, origin and my entrepreneurship journey, check out the other pages.</p>

	<h2 class="topic">Background</h2>

	<p>I was born and raised in Uganda. Uganda is located in the heart of Africa. It is home to 42 million people and the population is growing at an average of 3.7% per year (as of 2018). That means you should all expect more Ugandan babies in the upcoming years. Uganda is blessed with abundant sun, freshwater & a rich cultural diversity of people. We are home to 56 traditional tribes which all have respective languages, dances, cultural clothing & values. Despite the diversity, the people all thrive in unison. Uganda is known for its rich wildlife (including lions, giraffes, buffalos, crocodiles, hippopotamuses, etc), rich bird diversity and fresh-water lakes including Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa - mother to River Nile that is shared with Tanzania & Kenya. Uganda is a peaceful country that is vibrant with opportunity for growth habiting a people that treasure and preserve nature.</p>

	<h2 class="topic">Work</h2>

	<p>I take pleasure in starting and managing companies. So far, I have two companies legally registered and undergoing development. One is a non-profit entity aimed at empowering young people in my home country and another is a for-profit e-commerce entity in the construction & infrastructure industry. A lot more will be started as long as I am alive. I have attempted many startups in the travel & environmental sustainability industries. As time progresses, I hope to startup & co-found companies in the Robotics, Real Estate, Energy, Agriculture & Logistics industries. The hope is that these companies will get to improve the lives of our humanity and delegate the profit to the right reasons that advance a civilization in the appropriate direction.</p>

	<h2 class="topic">Interests</h2>

	<p>My love for numbers and making a change in the world has resulted in me taking an interest in Business, Computer Science & Robotics. During my Junior year, I went to study abroad in Shanghai, China which was a life changing experience. Aside from the great food that I enjoyed, I got a chance to put my python programming skills into practice. I worked with a startup called, MIRO AI - a sports AI company. They focused on image processing of athletes in marathons. It is through this experience I got a chance to learn more about Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence & the power of Big Data. From then on, my life has never been the same again. I am always looking for opportunities to enhance my knowledge and skills in the Data & the Technology sector. The language I am getting fluent at: python, statistics, machine learning and databases. My hope is that I can work work with numerous companies who have access to large data so that I can do what I do best ~ organize it, analyze it & interpret it to derive the best value.</p>
